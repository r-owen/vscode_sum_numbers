# Sum Numbers

Compute the sum of the numbers found at the beginning of each selected line, ignoring currency symbols.

## Instructions

Select the lines you want to sum.

Select "Sum Numbers" in the program bar (brought up by command-shift-P on macOS).

Note that the extension works on complete lines, from the first line through last line containing the selection.
